title: Lattice Hardness - Foundation of Post-Quantum Cryptography
tags: [pqc, lattice, cryptography, svp, lwe, vaultdrop]
summary: >
  This primer introduces key hard problems in lattice cryptography — 
  the mathematical backbone of NIST-standardized post-quantum schemes. 
  These problems remain hard even for quantum computers.

sections:
  - problem: Shortest Vector Problem (SVP)
    definition: >
      Given a lattice defined by a basis, find the shortest non-zero 
      vector in the lattice.
    hardness: Exponential-time complexity for high dimensions.
    application: Foundation for worst-case hardness assumptions in many 
    PQC schemes.

  - problem: Closest Vector Problem (CVP)
    definition: >
      Given a lattice and a target point, find the lattice vector 
      closest to the point.
    hardness: Considered harder than SVP in most settings.
    note: Used in cryptanalysis, rarely in direct cryptosystem design.

  - problem: Learning With Errors (LWE)
    definition: >
      Solve for a hidden vector s given a noisy set of linear 
      equations: A·s + e = b. The added error (e) makes it computationally hard.
    importance: Core assumption behind Kyber, Dilithium, and other NIST PQC schemes.
    analogy: Like solving Ax = b, except each b is slightly wrong — on purpose.

  - problem: Ring-LWE
    definition: >
      A structured variant of LWE that uses polynomial rings to reduce 
      size and improve efficiency.
    tradeoff: Smaller key sizes, but extra algebraic structure must be analyzed carefully.

  - cryptosystems:
      - name: Kyber
        type: Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM)
        based_on: Module-LWE
        status: NIST PQC Standard (Encryption)

      - name: Dilithium
        type: Digital Signature Scheme
        based_on: Module-LWE and Module-SIS
        status: NIST PQC Standard (Signature)

      - name: Falcon
        type: Digital Signature Scheme
        based_on: NTRU lattices, Gaussian sampling
        status: NIST Alternate Finalist

      - name: NTRU
        type: Encryption
        based_on: Structured lattice assumptions
        status: NIST Finalist; legacy usage in some applications
