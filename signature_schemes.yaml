title: Post-Quantum Signature Schemes
tags: [pqc, signatures, cryptography, dilithium, falcon, sphincs, vaultdrop]
summary: >
  A comparison of leading post-quantum digital signature schemes 
  selected or shortlisted by NIST, 
  including Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+. Highlights differences in 
  design, performance, and deployment implications.

schemes:
  - name: Dilithium
    type: Lattice-based
    basis: Module-LWE, Module-SIS
    status: NIST Standardized (Primary)
    key_size: ~1.3 KB
    signature_size: ~2.7 KB
    speed: Fast
    traits:
      - Stateless
      - Easy to implement securely
      - Resistant to side-channel attacks
    notes: >
      Chosen for balance across performance, simplicity, and 
      robustness. IBM contributed to CRYSTALS-Dilithium.

  - name: Falcon
    type: Lattice-based
    basis: NTRU lattice, Gaussian sampling
    status: NIST Alternate Finalist
    key_size: ~0.9 KB
    signature_size: ~666 bytes
    speed: Fast (in theory)
    traits:
      - Compact signatures
      - Mathematically elegant
      - Requires high-precision floating-point operations
    risks:
      - Fragile implementation
      - Susceptible to timing attacks if mishandled
    notes: >
      Ideal for bandwidth-constrained systems, but implementers must 
      tread carefully.

  - name: SPHINCS+
    type: Hash-based
    basis: Winternitz One-Time Signatures + Merkle trees
    status: NIST Standardized (Alternate)
    key_size: ~32 KB
    signature_size: 8â€“17 KB
    speed: Slow
    traits:
      - Stateless
      - No reliance on algebraic structures
      - Quantum-resistant by construction
    notes: >
      Considered a conservative fallback if lattice assumptions break. 
      Secure but large and slow.

use_cases:
  - Application signing
  - Secure boot processes
  - Certificate authorities
  - Long-term integrity (archives, logs)
