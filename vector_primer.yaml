title: Vector Primer for Post-Quantum Cryptography
tags: [cryptography, linear_algebra, pqc, vaultdrop]
summary: >
  Before you touch lattice encryption or post-quantum cryptography, 
  you must master the vector space they live in. 
  This primer teaches the essential concepts through examples and visual analogies.

sections:
  - concept: Vector
    definition: A quantity with both direction and magnitude in space.
    example: [3, 7, 1]

  - concept: 2D Vector Examples
    vectors:
      a: [3, 4]
      b: [-2, -6]
    description: Represented on a Cartesian graph; direction and length matter.

  - concept: Magnitude
    formula: ||a|| = √(a₁² + a₂²)
    note: Represents the "length" or size of a vector.

  - concept: Scaling
    description: Multiply a vector by a scalar to stretch or shrink its size.
    example: 2a = [6, 8]

  - concept: Normalization
    description: Rescale the vector so its magnitude becomes 1 (unit vector).

  - concept: Addition
    example: a + b = [2, -2]
    description: Vector addition combines direction and magnitude.

  - concept: Transpose
    description: Convert between column and row vector formats.
    notation: aᵗ

  - concept: Inner Product (Dot Product)
    formula: a·b = a₁b₁ + a₂b₂ + ... + aₙbₙ
    example:
      a: [3, 4]
      b: [1, 3]
      result: (3×1) + (4×3) = 15
    note: Measures angle-related similarity; used in cryptographic projections.

  - concept: Orthonormal Basis
    definition: A set of unit-length vectors that are all perpendicular to each other.
    example:
      x: 3×[1, 0] + 4×[0, 1] = [3, 4]

  - concept: Linear Independence
    definition: A vector is independent if it cannot be written as a combination of others.
    example:
      independent_vectors:
        - [1, 0]
        - [0, 1]
      note: These span the entire 2D space.
