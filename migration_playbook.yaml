title: Post-Quantum Migration Playbook
tags: [pqc, migration, cryptography, cisostrategy, vaultdrop]
summary: >
  A practical guide to migrating cryptographic systems to post-quantum 
  readiness. Includes phased actions, priority zones, and hybrid 
  deployment paths, aligned with NIST and CIS frameworks.

phases:
  - phase: Inventory
    description: >
      Map every system that uses cryptography, explicitly or 
      implicitly.
    actions:
      - Identify TLS endpoints, VPNs, email, SSH, internal PKI.
      - Scan binaries for embedded crypto libraries.
      - Include backup systems, CI/CD pipelines, firmware signing.

  - phase: Classification
    description: >
      Group assets by sensitivity and long-term value.
    actions:
      - Tag each item with lifespan: short (<2y), medium (2â€“10y), long-term (>10y).
      - Prioritize high-integrity zones: firmware, root certs, logs, digital ledgers.
      - Apply quantum-impact score: what happens if this is decrypted in 10 years?

  - phase: Crypto Agility
    description: >
      Implement systems that can swap crypto without total redesign.
    actions:
      - Design interfaces that support algorithm abstraction.
      - Pilot hybrid schemes (e.g., classical + Kyber/Dilithium).
      - Ensure you can rotate keys/algos without downtime.

  - phase: Migration Readiness
    description: >
      Phase in PQC without breaking existing trust chains.
    actions:
      - Test post-quantum TLS (e.g., Kyber+X25519 hybrids).
      - Start with internal services or low-risk comms.
      - Engage with vendors on their PQC roadmaps.

  - phase: Signature Focus
    description: >
      Migrate digital signatures before encryption.
    rationale: >
      Quantum attacks break signatures faster than encryption.
    actions:
      - Upgrade firmware signing, software updates, internal audit logs.
      - Begin testing with Dilithium or Falcon.
