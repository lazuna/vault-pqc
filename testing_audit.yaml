title: Post-Quantum Testing, Audit, and Monitoring Guide
tags: [pqc, testing, audit, observability, cryptography, vaultdrop]
summary: >
  This YAML drop outlines a structured approach for testing, logging, 
  and auditing post-quantum cryptographic systems. 
  Covers hybrid deployments, failure modes, SIEM integration, and 
  compliance visibility.

sections:
  - category: PQC Algorithm Behavior Testing
    goals:
      - Ensure deterministic and safe behavior across edge cases.
      - Validate hybrid fallback integrity.
    practices:
      - Run stress tests on keygen, encryption, and decryption under high load.
      - Simulate rejection sampling failures (e.g., Dilithium).
      - Confirm hybrid mode fallbacks work without downgrade attacks.
      - Validate signature verification timing consistency.

  - category: Logging & Telemetry
    goals:
      - Make PQC activity observable in production systems.
      - Capture cryptographic state transitions.
    logging_fields:
      - algorithm: e.g., kyber768, dilithium3
      - key_size: bits
      - signature_size: bytes
      - success/failure_reason: e.g., timeout, malformed_signature
      - hybrid_mode: true/false
      - cert_negotiation_trace: [classical_algos, pqc_algos, selected]
    tools:
      - instrument Open Quantum Safe libraries
      - export logs to SIEM or EDR pipeline

  - category: Threat Detection & SIEM Integration
    objectives:
      - Extend detection logic to PQC-aware workflows.
    detection_rules:
      - Alert on invalid PQC handshake attempts.
      - Flag excessive PQC negotiation failures (possible downgrade or DoS).
      - Detect malformed PQC traffic with invalid key exchange payloads.
    SIEM_hooks:
      - Custom parser for hybrid TLS logs
      - Timeline correlation between key negotiation and failure

  - category: Audit & Compliance
    goals:
      - Establish traceability for PQC operations.
      - Provide regulators and auditors with defensible logs.
    artifacts:
      - Log every key negotiation attempt (classical + PQC).
      - Timestamped signature generation + verification events.
      - Algorithm version control (e.g., Dilithium2 vs Dilithium3)
      - Backup records of all cryptographic policy changes
