title: LWE to Kyber - The Future of Encryption
tags: [pqc, kyber, lwe, cryptography, encryption, vaultdrop]
summary: >
  Kyber is the post-quantum encryption scheme based on the hardness of 
  Learning With Errors (LWE). 
  This drop breaks down the LWE assumption, how Kyber leverages it, and 
  why it’s the new standard after RSA and ECC.

sections:
  - concept: Learning With Errors (LWE)
    definition: >
      Given a set of linear equations with a small amount of noise injected, 
      recover the original secret vector. The noise makes solving exponentially hard.
    core_equation: A·s + e = b
    intuition: >
      It's like solving Ax = b, except each 'b' is distorted — and you 
      don’t know by how much.
    importance: >
      LWE is provably hard based on worst-case lattice problems (like 
      SVP), even against quantum computers.

  - concept: Module-LWE
    definition: >
      A structured variant of LWE used in Kyber, balancing efficiency 
      and security.
    tradeoff: >
      Smaller keys and ciphertexts with structured algebra for real-
      world practicality.

  - scheme: Kyber
    type: Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM)
    based_on: Module-LWE
    status: NIST PQC Standard (Encryption)
    versions:
      - Kyber512: Baseline security, compact
      - Kyber768: Recommended security (NIST Level 3)
      - Kyber1024: High-security (NIST Level 5)
    features:
      - IND-CCA2 secure (Chosen ciphertext attack resistant)
      - Stateless encapsulation
      - Highly efficient on constrained devices

  - comparison:
      rsa: >
        Relies on integer factorization. Broken by Shor’s algorithm. 
        Long keys. Slower.
      ecc: >
        Relies on elliptic curve discrete logs. Also broken by quantum. 
        Compact but vulnerable.
      kyber: >
        Lattice-based. Quantum-safe. Balanced size and speed. Chosen 
        for future standards.
