title: Post-Quantum Cryptography – Boardroom Messaging Guide
tags: [pqc, ciso, board, leadership, communication, vaultdrop]
summary: >
  A guide for translating post-quantum cryptographic risks and 
  readiness into language suitable for executive leadership and board 
  presentations.

themes:
  - theme: Trust, Not Math
    explanation: >
      Emphasize business continuity, cryptographic agility, and long-
      term resilience — not technical algorithms.
    example: >
      “Quantum computers threaten the trust layer of our systems — not 
      just how we encrypt, but how we prove integrity.”

  - theme: Signature Fragility
    explanation: >
      Stress that digital signatures (used in firmware, software 
      updates, logs, contracts) are more vulnerable than encryption.
    talking_point: >
      “If an attacker breaks our signatures, they can impersonate 
      updates and data authenticity — even if they can’t read our 
      traffic.”

  - theme: Lifespan Risk
    explanation: >
      Focus on data that must remain secure for years to decades.
    example_assets:
      - Root certificates
      - Long-lived audit logs
      - Firmware updates
      - Legal documents / contracts
    board_quote: >
      “If someone decrypts our audit logs in 2030, we can’t go back in 
      time and resecure them.”

  - theme: Crypto Agility as a KPI
    explanation: >
      Make agility measurable — how fast can we rotate keys, update 
      algorithms, or support hybrid schemes?
    board_prompt: >
      “If NIST updates standards tomorrow, how long would it take us 
      to comply?”

  - theme: Industry Validation
    explanation: >
      Use respected players as proof this isn’t fringe tech.
    companies:
      - IBM: Co-developed CRYSTALS-Kyber/Dilithium, deployed PQ TLS
      - Google: Chrome supports hybrid PQ handshakes
      - Cloudflare: PQ TLS pilot with Kyber and SIKE
      - Microsoft: PQC red team research and hybrid DNS tests

  - theme: Regulation and Readiness
    explanation: >
      Point to draft mandates and compliance roadmaps.
