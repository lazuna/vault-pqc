title: Quantum Threat Simulation Framework
tags: [pqc, redteam, simulation, cryptography, vaultdrop]
summary: >
  A structured set of post-quantum threat simulations for red and blue 
  teams. These tests help security teams validate system resilience, 
  visibility, and failover in hybrid PQC environments.

simulations:

  - name: TLS Downgrade to Classical
    description: >
      Simulate a client or intermediary forcing a downgrade from 
      PQC+classical hybrid mode to classical-only key exchange (e.g., X25519 only).
    purpose: >
      Test whether systems can detect, log, and prevent silent downgrade.
    detection_checklist:
      - Cert negotiation trace logs
      - Fallback alerts in SIEM
      - Unexpected cipher suite selection

  - name: Malformed Ciphertext Injection (Kyber)
    description: >
      Send corrupted or oversized Kyber ciphertexts to the key 
      decapsulation interface.
    outcomes:
      - Graceful error? Crash? Silent failure?
      - Logging of invalid PQ traffic?
    mitigation_checklist:
      - Input validation in PQC library
      - Try-catch boundary at encapsulation/decryption layer

  - name: Oversized Signature Flood (Dilithium)
    description: >
      Inject signatures slightly above the expected size to test 
      parsing and boundary enforcement.
    purpose:
      Identify parsing edge cases and performance degradation.
    detection_checklist:
      - Signature size range alerts
      - Excessive error logs on signature verification

  - name: Time Budget Exploit (Falcon)
    description: >
      Send high-volume Falcon signatures under load to trigger high-
      precision math slowdowns.
    outcomes:
      - Latency spikes
      - Missed service health alerts
    mitigation_checklist:
      - CPU budget profiling
      - Application-level timeout handling

  - name: Certificate Mismatch Attack
    description: >
      Present certificates with PQC algorithms that don't match the 
      expected profiles or chains.
    purpose: >
      Test CA path validation logic under hybrid confusion.
    red_flags:
      - Cert accepted without PQ algorithm enforcement
      - TLS stack fallback to legacy cert path silently

  - name: Hybrid Handshake Manipulation (MITM)
    description: >
      Attempt man-in-the-middle manipulation of PQ payloads in hybrid 
      TLS handshakes.
    outcomes:
      - Downgrade attack resilience
      - Unexpected cert/key mismatch detection
    detection_checklist:
      - PQ cert fingerprint mismatch
      - Session negotiation path anomaly
